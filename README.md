This intensive, hands-on course will teach you how to use the built-in monitoring stack and Kubernetes-native tools like kube-burner to stress-test your cluster's networking and control plane. We'll dive into establishing performance baselines, finding bottlenecks before they become problems, and getting the data you need to keep your platform running smoothly and efficiently.
