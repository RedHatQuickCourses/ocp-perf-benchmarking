# About this Training

**Click here: [![Contribute](https://www.eclipse.org/che/contribute.svg)](https://devspaces.apps.tools-na100.dev.ole.redhat.com/#https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/ocp-perf-benchmarking) to start the development using devspace.**

This intensive, hands-on course will teach you how to use the built-in monitoring stack and Kubernetes-native tools like kube-burner to stress-test your cluster's control plane and data plane. We'll dive into effectively using these tools to establish performance baselines, find bottlenecks before they become problems, and get the data you need to keep your platform running smoothly and efficiently. The content is designed to be useful to a range of personas beyond performance engineers. These tools are useful across the stack: they help application developers set realistic performance expectations, enable architects to plan cluster capacity and define SLOs with confidence, allow platform administrators to baseline performance and continuously track SLIs, and support the broader ecosystem by stress-testing plugins and platform components under real-world conditions.
