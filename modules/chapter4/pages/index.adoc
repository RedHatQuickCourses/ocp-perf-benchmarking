= Understanding Openshift networking

OpenShift networking is the foundation that enables communication **within a cluster** as well as **between the cluster and external systems**. Effective networking is critical for ensuring application performance, reliability, and security.

Traffic in OpenShift is generally categorized into two types, north-south and east-west, which we will describe in the next sections.

== North-South traffic

 * **Definition:** Traffic that **enters or exits** the cluster, originating from clients, external services, or the internet.
 * **Example:** A user accesses a web application hosted in OpenShift via an external URL. The request passes through the OpenShift **ingress controller**, which routes it to the appropriate pod serving the application.

North-South traffic represents the interaction between the cluster and the outside world, and it must be managed to ensure secure and efficient access. Includes ingress and egress scenarios.

== East-West traffic

 * **Definition:** Traffic between pods **within the cluster** or between nodes.
 * **Example:** A backend service pod communicates with a database pod located on a different node. This traffic remains internal to the cluster network and is optimized for low-latency, high-throughput communication.

East-West traffic is essential for internal application interactions, supporting the communication patterns of distributed and microservices-based architectures. Includes host-networked scenarios (node to node) along with virtual traffic scenarios (pod to pod, pod to service, etc.)

---

OpenShift leverages a **software-defined network (SDN)** to manage these traffic flows. The SDN abstracts the underlying network, enabling seamless pod-to-pod communication, enforcing network policies, and providing reliable connectivity across nodes.

In summary, OpenShift networking ensures that applications can communicate **efficiently and securely**, whether traffic is flowing **internally within the cluster** or **externally to clients**.

OpenShift leverages https://ovn-kubernetes.io/[OVN-Kubernetes], a powerful Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin, to provide a scalable, SDN-based networking backend that delivers advanced routing, policy, and overlay capabilities across the cluster.

After completing this module, you'll be ready to:

 * Benchmark the data plane using different cloud-native tooling:
   ** k8s-netperf
   ** ingress-perf
 * Differentiate between different network traffic patterns:
   ** host-network traffic (node to node)
   ** virtual traffic (pod to pod, pod to service)
   ** ingress traffic
