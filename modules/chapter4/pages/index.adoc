= Understanding Openshift Networking

OpenShift networking is the foundation that enables communication **within a cluster** as well as **between the cluster and external systems**. Effective networking is critical for ensuring application performance, reliability, and security.

Traffic in OpenShift is generally categorized into two types:

---

## North-South Traffic
- **Definition:** Traffic that **enters or exits** the cluster, originating from clients, external services, or the internet.
- **Example:** A user accesses a web application hosted in OpenShift via an external URL. The request passes through the OpenShift **ingress controller**, which routes it to the appropriate pod serving the application.

North-South traffic represents the interaction between the cluster and the outside world, and it must be managed to ensure secure and efficient access.

---

## East-West Traffic
- **Definition:** Traffic between pods **within the cluster** or between nodes.
- **Example:** A backend service pod communicates with a database pod located on a different node. This traffic remains internal to the cluster network and is optimized for low-latency, high-throughput communication.

East-West traffic is essential for internal application interactions, supporting the communication patterns of distributed and microservices-based architectures.

OpenShift leverages a **software-defined network (SDN)** to manage these traffic flows. The SDN abstracts the underlying network, enabling seamless pod-to-pod communication, enforcing network policies, and providing reliable connectivity across nodes.

In summary, OpenShift networking ensures that applications can communicate **efficiently and securely**, whether traffic is flowing **internally within the cluster** or **externally to clients**.
