= Understanding OVN-Kubernetes

In OpenShift, **OVN-Kubernetes (OVN-K)** provides the networking fabric that connects pods across nodes. Consider **Pod A** on Node 1 communicating with **Pod B** on Node 2. The major components involved are explained below, using **ovnkube-controller as the CMS equivalent**.

---

## 1. ovnkube-controller (CMS)
- Runs on the **control plane node(s)**.
- Acts as the **central authority** for cluster networking.
- Responsibilities:
  * Maintains the logical network representation for all pods and namespaces.
  * Synchronizes network policies and logical switches/routers with the OVN Northbound Database (NBDB).
- **Performance and scale:** In large clusters, it must process thousands of pod and network policy updates efficiently to prevent connectivity delays.

---

## 2. OVN Northbound Database (nbdb)
- Stores **high-level logical network configuration**:
  * Logical switches (pod networks)
  * Logical routers (routing between networks)
  * Access control policies (who can communicate with whom)
- Receives updates from the **ovnkube-controller**.
- **Clients:** `ovnkube-controller` (above) and `ovn-northd` (below).
- **Scale note:** As cluster size increases, NBDB grows; ovn-northd ensures updates are efficiently propagated to SBDB.

---

## 3. ovn-northd
- Translates the **logical network configuration** from NBDB into **node-level flows** stored in the Southbound Database (SBDB).
- Calculates routes and encodings for pods across nodes.
- Ensures traffic is **policy-compliant** and optimized for latency and throughput.

---

## 4. OVN Southbound Database (SBDB)
- Stores **low-level instructions** for each node to implement the logical network.
- Contains:
  * **Physical Network (PN) tables:** How to reach each node.
  * **Logical Network (LN) tables:** Pod-to-pod connectivity rules.
  * **Binding tables:** Maps logical network elements to physical nodes.
- **Clients:** ovn-northd above, ovn-controller on each node below.
- **Performance:** Must scale with node and pod count; large clusters may require SBDB optimization.

---

## 5. ovn-controller (per node)
- Runs on every **worker node**.
- Responsibilities:
  * Reads SBDB to configure **Open vSwitch flows**.
  * Updates PN and Binding tables with node and pod status.
  * Handles **encapsulation/decapsulation** for pod-to-pod traffic (usually via Geneve tunnels).
- **Scale/performance:** Each node handles all local pod traffic; efficient flow programming minimizes latency.

---

## 6. ovs-vswitchd and ovsdb-server
- **ovs-vswitchd:** Local software switch that forwards traffic according to flows programmed by ovn-controller.
- **ovsdb-server:** Stores node-level Open vSwitch configuration.
- Ensures Pod A → Pod B traffic is **encapsulated, routed, and delivered** correctly.

---

### Summary of traffic flow
(Data path) Pod 1 → ovs-vswitchd → Geneve encapsulation → ovs-vswitchd → Pod 2

(Control path) ovnkube-controller → NBDB → ovn-northd → SBDB → ovn-controller → ovs-vswitchd


This architecture ensures **scalable, reliable, and high-performance pod-to-pod communication** in OpenShift clusters.
