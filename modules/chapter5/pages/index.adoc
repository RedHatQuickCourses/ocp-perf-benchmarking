= Control plane and scalability testing with kube-burner

[kube-burner](https://github.com/kube-burner/kube-burner) is a CNCF hosted project designed for Kubernetes control plane performance testing. It enables users to simulate various scenarios, such as node failures or updates, to assess how the control plane responds under stress. Key features include:

- Configuring kube-burner jobs for customized testing environments
- Measuring Control Plane Responsiveness by observing key metrics during simulated churn events
- Hands-on experience with kube-burner, providing practical understanding of cluster behavior and control plane resilience

To get started, create a dedicated namespace and service account for kube-burner using the provided shell commands. If running tests with `hostNetwork` enabled, additional permissions are required for the netperf service account. Run your first test with `./bin/k8s-netperf --all`, which performs comprehensive network performance assessments including TCP, UDP, and request/response tests. Customize tests further using available command-line options like `--across` to schedule pods across availability zones or `--json` for JSON output of test results.
