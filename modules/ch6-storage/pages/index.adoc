= Storage benchmarking

== Overview

Storage performance is a critical pillar of any OpenShift deployment.
Whether you are running stateful applications, databases, logging stacks, or AI/ML workloads, understanding how your storage backend behaves under load is essential for ensuring reliability, scalability, and predictable latency.

== What you’ll learn

This chapter provides a practical, hands-on introduction to benchmarking storage in OpenShift.
You will learn how to evaluate the efficiency of different storage backends, measure throughput and latency, detect bottlenecks, and interpret performance metrics that matter for real-world workloads.

We'll explore Kubernetes-native tools, industry-standard benchmarking suites, and OpenShift-integrated observability features to help you validate the storage performance of OpenShift clusters.

== Next steps

After completing this module, you will have a solid foundation for designing reliable and performance-aware storage deployments on OpenShift:

 * Validate the performance characteristics of your Persistent Volumes (PVs).
 * Compare multiple storage classes or providers on equal terms.
 * Build repeatable, automated benchmarking workflows.
 * Translate raw metrics into actionable insights for capacity planning and optimization.
